            <h2>How to Play: A Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
            <p>Basketball Stars begins with players choosing their dream team or dream basketball players. Whether you are a long-time fan of the NBA or just a casual gamer looking to have a great time, you only need a few minutes to know about the rules of this game. Here are the key points of Basketball Stars:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each match lasts for one minute only. Players can track the remaining time by looking at the timer in the upper-center corner of the screen. At the end of the match, the team that scores the most points wins the game.</li>
                <li>Depending on whether players are keeping the ball or not, there are two different strategies: attacking and defending. To achieve victory, players will need to decide which strategy to follow. Prevent your opponents from scoring by jumping to block their shots, or take the initiative, snatch the ball from their hand, and score points!</li>
                <li>Each player has one of four special abilities. Utilize his ability and cooperate with your teammate to score the most points possible!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That sums up everything you need to know. Now it’s time to start playing on the court!</p>

            <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>While players can try to shoot the hoops as soon as they get hold of the ball, it is best that they get close enough to the hoop to get the highest chance of scoring.</li>
                <li>For the special abilities Mega Dunk and Alley-Oop, as soon as they are available to players, use them immediately for a 100% chance of scoring.</li>
                <li>Try to dribble the ball while advancing past opponents to prevent them from grabbing it.</li>
                <li>Players can score more points per shot when the timer is about to run out. As such, one popular strategy is to concentrate solely on defending the basketball hoop, then be on the offensive towards the end of the match.</li>
                <li>If you choose 2v2 matches, try to experiment with different special ability combinations and pick the ones that suit your playstyle the best.</li>
